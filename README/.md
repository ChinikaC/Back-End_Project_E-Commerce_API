### ***Project Overview*** 

 Our team had taken interest particularly in eBay and Amazon who are both online marketplaces that allow individuals and businesses to buy and sell a wide variety of goods and services. We deliberately chose this task as we wanted our API to encompass a range of our learning and extend it, incorporating ideas such as....
 
 <br />

 Our team name, *GRECHIMO*, relates to each of our three first names, and also a slight play on words when including the "bay" terminology added commonly to marketplaces such as eBay. 
 
#### ***Technologies*** 

 - We used Java to code our API and utilized Git to commit changes and store our code on GitHub, along with UML and ERD diagrams. The platform proved to be very helpful in keeping track of our modifications and allowing us to revert to previous versions of the code if needed.
<br />

-  SpringIntializr was imperative for us to use as we were able to implement dependencies which allowed us to utilise particular functions and commands. For instance, we utilised SpringBoot to implement the Spring framework, JPA to convert JSON and Java, and SQL to manage our relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them. We group coded in IntellliJ using the the GIT framework to work on seperate branches, to later combine and collaborate on eachtohers code. Finally, we used postman to test our functions. These platforms allowed us to test our code and import a variety of functions to create our tables and extend our beans (Examples: @JPARepositories, @Component etc).

#### ***Drawbacks*** 
- One of our issues was familiarising ourselves with new beans (@Tranzient) and also new functionalities we included to assist with CRUD tasks, specifically allowing users to delete products from their cart. We researched how to resolve the issue and soon completely understood and were able to effectively execute a working MVP we could build on.

#### ***Future*** 🔑
If granted more time, we would like to develop more functions to create more features. These include:

- Bidding functionality = giving sellers the opportunity to list products to be bidded on amongst buyers with a time scale in mind for when bids will no longer be taken.
